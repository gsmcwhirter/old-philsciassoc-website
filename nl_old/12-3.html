Education<span lang="en-us">.&nbsp; Deadline:</span> March 31, 2007.<br>
<br>
Special Issue / New Section<br>
<br>
Science Education has a long tradition of publishing articles about&nbsp;the 
relationships between history and philosophy of science and&nbsp;science education. 
Science Education published the first scholarly papers on sociology of science 
and science education. Recently, it&nbsp;has provided a vibrant forum for research on 
argumentation and&nbsp;scientific discourse, drawing from such fields as 
rhetoric,&nbsp;epistemology, and cognitive sciences. As educational research moves&nbsp;to 
more nuanced understandings of science teaching and learning, we&nbsp;believe we can 
both learn from science studies as well as provide&nbsp;evidence relevant to the 
“blind spot” of science studies --&nbsp; education. In 2007 Science Education will 
publish a special issue and&nbsp;institute a new section of the journal focusing on 
“Science Studies&nbsp;&amp; Science Education.”<br>
<br>
The intents of this special issue are:<br>
<br>
1. To clarify/illuminate/analyze/discuss the potential significance&nbsp;of science 
studies for science education;<br>
<br>
2. To provide a forum for the scholarly exchange of ideas and&nbsp;theories regarding 
science education and science studies;<br>
<br>
3. To launch a new “Science Studies &amp; Science Education” section&nbsp;for Science 
Education.<span lang="en-us">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Science Studies” is a group of 
disciplines that draw from&nbsp;history, philosophy, anthropology and sociology of 
science as well as&nbsp;cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence. The primary 
focus&nbsp;of Science Studies is to understand science as an epistemic and socio- 
historical endeavor. The study of science classrooms as 
environments&nbsp;characterized by epistemic, cognitive, social and affective 
factors&nbsp;should benefit from Science Studies scholarship.&nbsp; Science Studies&nbsp;holds 
the potential to contribute to the policy and practice level&nbsp;implementation in 
science education. Hence, for the special issue and&nbsp;the subsequent establishment 
of the new section on science studies we&nbsp;will solicit manuscripts that develop 
our understanding of how&nbsp;Science Studies applies to theory, methodology, policy 
and practice&nbsp;of science education.<br>
<br>
Some example applications of Science Studies in science education&nbsp;might include 
the following questions:<br>
<br>
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Epistemic Questions: How are ideas formulated, evaluated and&nbsp;developed in 
science? In science teaching and learning?<br>
<br>
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cognitive Questions: What constitute scientists’ ways of&nbsp;reasoning? What 
can we learn from cognitive analyses of scientists to&nbsp;help school children and 
university students in learning science?<br>
<br>
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historical Questions: How do scientific and classroom ideas&nbsp;change over 
time?&nbsp;&nbsp; What factors contribute to change?<br>
<br>
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anthropological Questions: How are classroom and research&nbsp;group cultures 
produced?&nbsp; Maintained?&nbsp; Changed?<br>
<br>
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sociological Questions: What historical, political and social&nbsp;norms 
characterize and guide the scientific enterprise? How do such&nbsp;norms translate to 
classroom science learning environments?<br>
<br>
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AI Questions: What logical and other formal reasoning&nbsp;capabilities and 
patterns underlie domain specific inquiry in science&nbsp;and scientific thinking? 
Are there general patterns of reasoning that&nbsp;<span lang="en-us">a</span>re 
valuable across all scientific domains?<br>
<br>
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Political Questions:&nbsp; How do we implement the theoretically&nbsp;best 
educational practices into the very constrained real world of&nbsp;science education?<br>
<br>
Manuscripts for this Special Issue should be submitted online.&nbsp; Information 
regarding the preparation of manuscripts and directions&nbsp;for online submission is 
available at:<span lang="en-us"> </span>

<br>
A Rationale for Science Studies and Science Education<br>
<br>
The label “science studies” is relatively new and has many&nbsp;meanings so we think 
it is beneficial for us to share our working&nbsp;understanding. Examples of Science 
Studies’ disciplines include&nbsp;history of science, sociology of science, 
anthropological studies of&nbsp;science, philosophy of science and 
cognitive/psychological/AI studies&nbsp;of scientific reasoning. The oldest of the 
science study disciplines&nbsp;is philosophy of science dating back to antiquity. 
History of science&nbsp;was established in the academy at the beginning of the 20th 
century&nbsp;with sociology of science not far behind. Cognitive science and 
AI&nbsp;emerged at the beginning of the second half of the 20th century 
with&nbsp;anthropology of science being the most nascent of the group.&nbsp; Like<span lang="en-us">
</span>science itself, the initial forays were mainly pursued 
individually&nbsp;without the benefits of journals, conferences, associations 
or&nbsp;specialized educational programs.<br>
<br>
The twentieth century saw the institutionalization of the science&nbsp;studies 
subjects with some attempts to join them in Centers and&nbsp;Programs for the History 
and Philosophy of Science.&nbsp; Prior to 1960,&nbsp;history of science was divided into 
two types—internal and external&nbsp;histories. Internal histories of science were 
concerned with the&nbsp;concepts and logic of theories; external histories were 
concerned&nbsp;with the broader institutional, cultural and technological&nbsp;influences, 
such as the differences in the acceptance of Newtonian&nbsp;theory in England and 
France or the role of science societies in the&nbsp;advancement of science. Prior to 
1960 the philosophy of science with&nbsp;its’ emphasis on logic and language was 
almost exclusively internal.<br>
<br>
Under the influence of Kuhn’s Structure of Scientific Revolutions<span lang="en-us">
</span>and similar research such as that by Norwood Hanson, Michael Polanyi,&nbsp;Stephen 
Toulmin, Robert Merton, Ludwig Fleck, and Ernst Nagel, among&nbsp;others, the 
assumption that internal and external accounts could be&nbsp;pursued independently 
was rejected. Kuhn’s work encouraged other&nbsp;disciplines to take science itself as 
a subject and psychology,&nbsp;anthropology, and economics of science all were born. 
The&nbsp;“internal” study of science assumed that the development of&nbsp;science could be 
studied as a purely logical enterprise without&nbsp;consideration of such factors as 
the nature of the human mind, the&nbsp;availability of social networks, of social 
norms, of competitive and&nbsp;cooperative motivations, of social rewards and risks, 
of information&nbsp;networks or of the financial support for the process. In the 
last&nbsp;several decades these factors have been studied and while most&nbsp;research 
tends to focus on one or two dimensions, fruitful&nbsp;interactions are increasingly 
common.<br>
<br>
Just as internal history and philosophy of science had a narrow focus&nbsp;on the 
logic of scientific processes, research shows that science&nbsp;education has had and 
continues to have a similar narrow focus on&nbsp;logical and conceptual elements. 
Science studies now recognize that&nbsp;scientists do not just collect data, they 
design experiments to&nbsp;collect the data and they refine and interpret both the 
data and&nbsp;experiments. In each case what they could do and what they actually&nbsp;do 
are influenced by their motivations, by the social, informational&nbsp;and 
technological resources available, and by the available&nbsp;alternative theories and 
models. Scientists also write about, read&nbsp;and argue about data, models, theories 
and explanations and in each&nbsp;case there are social and cultural contexts that 
influence their&nbsp;interpretations or their choice of statements.<br>
<br>
Students also learn and do science within contexts that include all&nbsp;of these 
factors. Ignoring these factors does not make them&nbsp;irrelevant, it only means 
that science education has been blind to&nbsp;them. Our goal is to broaden the range 
of issues, interpretative&nbsp;frameworks, and methodological orientations relevant 
to the&nbsp;production of knowledge in educational settings. Establishing a 
new&nbsp;section of the journal will create a forum for the exchange of&nbsp;scholarly 
ideas and research results on “Science Studies &amp; Science&nbsp;Education.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Given the current focus on domain-specific inquiry in science&nbsp;education, it 
becomes imperative to achieve a fuller comprehension of&nbsp;the nature of reasoning 
in various disciplines and subdisciplines.&nbsp; Further, there is a need for deeper 
understanding of the epistemic,&nbsp;material, linguistic, and communicative, and 
representational&nbsp;practices in these areas. Another important area of 
needed&nbsp;scholarship is the rich science/society interactions 
continually&nbsp;occurring and how these ongoing practices are situated in 
broader&nbsp;social, intellectual, political, and economic contexts. Work with 
and&nbsp;within these domains could contribute significantly to understanding&nbsp;science 
thus informing educators as they help students and the public&nbsp;to understand and 
critique scientific knowledge and knowledge about&nbsp;science.<br>
<br>
Another viable area of research concerns the place of activities&nbsp;related to 
science education in Western society and how this view&nbsp;compares and contrasts 
with science in other cultural and&nbsp;technological contexts.&nbsp; This focus would 
include manuscripts&nbsp;addressing the present-day politics of science and science 
education,&nbsp;and the publics’ engagement in matters of science education 
and&nbsp;policy making. Decisions here are important because they depend on&nbsp;whether 
we are considering education related to the reproduction of&nbsp;disciplinary 
practices (technical mastery) or education aimed at a&nbsp;more general, citizen 
level of understanding. And then there is also&nbsp;the need to consider at what 
level (e.g., elementary to post&nbsp;graduate) and in which contexts (e.g., formal/in 
school to informal/ out of school) such decisions are appropriate or not. While 
some&nbsp;science education researchers explore such issues, the extent to&nbsp; <br>
which these scholars use or reference the knowledge bases of science&nbsp;studies is 
an open question. The special issue and the new section&nbsp;aim to expand scholarly 
discourse by including traditional and&nbsp;contemporary perspectives that frame our 
understandings about science&nbsp;as a way of knowing.<span lang="en-us">&nbsp;
</span>We hope that the special issue and the new section will create a&nbsp;forum 
where cross-disciplinary boundaries are challenged and where&nbsp;considerations of 
science and science classrooms as cultural and&nbsp;epistemic endeavors will 
stimulate reconceptualizations of the&nbsp;traditionally distinct fields of 
anthropology and epistemology.<br>
